# jquery-mosaic
See documentation and working examples on http://jquery-mosaic.tin.cat

A jQuery plugin by Tin.cat that builds responsive mosaics of images or any other content fitted to match heights in multiple rows while maintaining aspect ratios.

Works wonderfully with images by creating a visually ordered and pleasant mosaic (much like mosaics on Flickr, 500px and Google+) without gaps between elements, but at the same time respecting aspect ratios. Reacts to window resizes and adapts responsively to any screen size.

### Version history
* **v0.15.2** Added maxRows option for those situations where you need fine control on the maximum number of rows of your mosaic. Added advanced options maxItemsToShowWhenResponsiveThresholdSurpassed and showTailWhenNotEnoughItemsForEvenOneRow for even more fine-grained control of your mosaic. Mosaic is not resized when it's hidden and support for VIDEO elements thanks to [@borekl](https://github.com/borekl)
* **v0.15** Added the ability to pass parameters as html data-* attributes. Solved floating point width bug for compatibility with jQuery versions < 3. Thanks to [@BenTalagan](https://github.com/BenTalagan).
* **v0.14** New maxRowHeightPolicy 'tail' that renders items respecting their aspect ratio without surpassing the specified maxRowHeight, resulting in a last row that might not completely fit the screen horizontally, suggested by [@borekl](https://github.com/borekl) and [@nzjrs](https://github.com/nzjrs).
* **v0.13** New outerMargin and innerGap parameters.

### Compatibility
* Requires at least jQuery version 3.3.0
* Tested successfully on Safari 11.1, Chrome 65.0.3325.181 and Firefox 59.0.2
