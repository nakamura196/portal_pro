“Like Father-Like Son”Look well upon this face - cruel, sensual, malignant - the face of Frederick Wilhelm Victor August Ernest, Crown Prince of Germany, chief of the Death’s Head Hussars, and one of the six uninjured sons of the Kaiser.This man with his mad lust for power, inherited and fostered from infancy by his father, has led millions of his own people to their death and plans some day to rule the world.This war is a Crusade against a faithless and savage despotism! Smash its power forever! Avenge Belgium’s sacred “Scrap of Paper,” France’s outraged women and murdered children, our own assassinated citizens on the open sea!The Fourth Liberty Loan is a lot of money, but it’s a small sum in the balance of liberty and justice -Buy Liberty Bonds all you have the cash to pay for, and all you can possibly swing on installments, and sign up on the first day of the campaign, September 28th.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（「父のように、息子のように」）
