“On-with the Tanks!”Smash ‘em and crash ‘em, and treat ‘em rough!Jam ‘em and cram ‘em that’s the stuff!Every man-jack of ‘em wants you in back of ‘em buying your bonds from the banks!Every last son of ‘em says to buy one of ‘em while they go on with the tanks!Yes, on with the tanks, and on with the ships, and on with the guns, and on with the bullets, and on with the bayonets, and on with your dollars to send them over and keep them there and send them forward, forward to Berlin!Buy Liberty Bonds with every dollar you can possibly spare and then buy more on installments with all you can save in the months to come. This Liberty Loan is a vast sum, but it’s the least we can do for the boys who are fighting for us. Get back of the Loan ・buy more bonds!This space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（「戦車と共に出発せよ！」）
