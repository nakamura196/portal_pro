Keine BannwareDer GrossdampferLusitaniaDurch Ein DeutschesTauchboote VersenktSMAI 1915And they struck off a medal for this.“On May 7th, 1915,  the Steamship Lusitania, since proven in court to be an unarmed passenger craft carrying no munitions, was sent to the bottom with 1198 souls.“There is here reproduced one side of a medal which was designed and struck off by the German Government in advance of the dead and dated may 5th, two days before the actual sinking.” From official report.They were passengers on the Lusitania. An hour before they had been very happy, this mother and her little children, as, sitting on the deck of the great craft, the soft kiss of salt wind brought new color to the cheeks, new light to the eyes. Their bodies rest now at the bottom of the sea, these unoffending victims of German “valor”, but their souls have been gathered to the great heart of the Great Father.Humanity will never forgot this terrible crime. 1198 human souls, men, mothers, sisters and little children, foully murdered without a moment’s warning. Our boys, side by side with other boys of the earth, are on their way to Berlin to demand an accounting from the hypocritical Kaiser and his Potsdam gang.Oh, Americans, buy bonds with every dollar you have and every dollar you can save to speed their going.This space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!（彼らはこのためにメダルを打ち出した）
