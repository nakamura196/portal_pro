“Her Boy!”“My star in my flag, put there for my boy. Love him?Yes, more than I love my own life! Miss him? Why my heart seems empty save for the ache in it! Want him back? Never until he wins his great fight his fight to make his mother safe, to make the other mothers of the world safe!“Yes! My star in my flag; my boy who is fighting for me! God bring him home again, but if the star turns to gold, God give me strength to say, ‘Not my will, but Thine, Oh God, be done!’”And you fathers and older brothers, and other mothers, all the money you have in the world cannot equal the life blood our boys are giving over there, and if you do less than buy every bond you can with the money you have, and then every one you can carry on the installment plan in the months to come, you must blush with shame at every service flag you see.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest 4 1/4 %.The time to act is now!The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（「彼女の息子! 」）
