The Meaning of AmericaCreedI believe in America because of her Ideals, worked out in institution that are just.She gives everyone the right to rise;To take a part in making equal laws;To hold his neighbor equal to himself;To speak the truth and to resent a lie;To serve no man as master, but by toil to earn.The right to call himself a man.I believe in the world mission of American Ideals. By them, expressed in terms of nations;Right can be made to vanquish Force and Fraud;Justice to reign, sustained by potent law;The weaker states to live as live the strong.I believe in America because she thinks in terms of justice, not of gain, and holds her noble heritage the right of all.Liberty Enlightening the WorldBedloe’s Island, New YorkArmed FreedomDome of Capitol, WashingtonWhen you say “An American,” What do you mean?The word, “American,” has no relation to blood. You may be of pure German blood and yet be a real American. You may be of pure Irish blood and yet be a real American. You my be of Russian, Hebrew, Italian, Polish, French. Belgian or Austrian blood, and yet be as real an American as if your ancestors had come to this country on board the Mayflower, or had fought with Washington to create the Republic, or later, with Lincoln, to save it. There are more than twenty-six million people in the United States today who were born in other countries, or whose parents were foreign-born. Each and every one of these is or may easily become a real American, if he has but the spirit of loyalty to the ideals which have made this nation out of many races.No man, woman, or child who wishes special privileges, is a real American. No man, woman, or child who knowingly denies to another equal rights is a real American
