4th Liberty Loan BondWhat’s Back of Every BondA United States Liberty Bond is the safest, best secured investment in the entire world today. Back of it are the almost unlimited resources of the richest country in the whole world. The mineral wealth in our mountains, the agricultural wealth of our plains, the oil sweeping through our soil, our river banks bristling with industrial plants, our cities with their wealth of real estate, our forests and our herds ・all these and much more are the collateral our Government offers in its promise to pay back every dollar invested in the purchase of Liberty Bonds.Pledge yourself, then, to buy all the Liberty Bonds you have the cash to pay for and all you can carry on installments. Save as you never saved before to secure a speedy and lasting peace.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4　1/4%.The time to action is now!This space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（第4回自由公債公債を支えてくれるのは）
