Our Allies Are Watching UsThe last day!In Paris, in London, in Rome, in stricken Brussels, eager eyes are watching the reports of the results of America`s Fourth Liberty Loan.Will America carry on? Our own boys in the trenches, the lads at sea, are looking for the answer from the folks at Home!What is your answer? You have only today to make it-only today to do your full duty! Only today to answer our Allies! Only today to encourage our boys with your limit of Liberty Bonds! Only today in which to go deep down into your pocket, and to pledge yourself to buy Bonds with every dollar you can save in the months ahead, that your answer in this Fourth Liberty Loan may meet your obligations to the nations who have fought, and the boys who are fighting for Decency, for Justice, for Civilization!Here’s your chance! Make your answer ring! Buy more Bonds today!There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（連合国は私たちを見ている）
