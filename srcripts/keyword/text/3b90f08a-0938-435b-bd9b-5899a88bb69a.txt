Bonds build boats.Think of the millions of tons the Hun vipers of the sea have sent to the bottom, from great passenger Lusitanias to unoffending little fishing smacks!But America and American Labor have sprung to the breach we are launching ships every day!We have thrilled the world with our beginning and stricken the sneer from the lips of the beast at Berlin. You must help keep it up! Bonds will buy the steel, the wood, the concrete. Bonds will buy the keels and drive the rivets. Bonds will set our flag at the mast-head of the greatest merchant fleet that ever rode the seas.Well, then, don’t put it off ‘till tomorrow; buy Bonds today with every cent you can get together. Then pledge to buy more bonds on the installment plan with all you can save in the months to come.The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with the interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!（公債は船を建造する）
