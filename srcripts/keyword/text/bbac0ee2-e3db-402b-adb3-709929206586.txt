MJohn Tay163The Highest PriceOn Flanders fields the poppies blow and green grass ripples over many a brave boy who has given his all for you.Over there on the blood-stained lands of France our boys are paying their highest price that the Peace of God’s Kingdom may prevail again upon earth, that you and your children and your children’s children may live and be free!Buy Liberty Bonds to stamp out the plague of the Hun for all time. Buy them with all the money you have and buy them on installments with all you can save in the months to come.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!This space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（崇高な犠牲）
