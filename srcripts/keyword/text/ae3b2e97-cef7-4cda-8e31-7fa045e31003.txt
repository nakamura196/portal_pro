Where Duty LeadsThe magnificent poem on this page was contributed by the famous Scottish poet, Robert Burns, in April, 1793, to Thomson’s collection.Martial thought throbbed in the veins of Burns all his life.Hannibal’s history was the first book he ever read.The second was the history of Wallace, whose name, to him, was like the blast of a trumpet. As an urchin he strutted up and down, as he tells us in his autobiography, after the recruiting drum and bagpipe, wishing himself, then, already tall enough to be a soldier.When overwhelmed by dejection in his hale young manhood, at three and twenty, he braced himself to new efforts, and raised himself to the full height of his five feet nine inches, when trolling forth his defiant song, “O, why the deuce should I repine, I’ll go and be a sodger.”Finally, in this noble ballad, which is, in itself, a very romance in miniature, he sang of life, and love, and patriotism, as he had realized them himself, in their full intensity.Love of country and love of kin never beat more strongly in any human breast than in that of the celebrated lyrist who has bequeathed this, with so many other treasures of song, to his fellow -mortals and to his beloved Caledonia.“During the early Napoleonic wars recruiting throughout Great Britain and Ireland was slow. The sympathies of the British democracy had largely been with the cause of the French people as against their autocratic rulers, and the tyranny of the revolution followed by a worse form under Bonaparte had not yet been fully recognized by the good people of the British Isles.“Recruiting was at a standstill. Press gangs were capturing citizens off the streets - a rather drastic from of conscription. Speakers  were found at every corner urging others to go and fight. The pulpit did, the same, but still recruiting was reduced to a minimum.“Finally, Robbie Burns came to the rescue the democratic bard, the people’s idol, the man who understood the human heart. He published the famous poem ‘The soldier’s return,’ and the ranks of the British army were filled us if by magic. Robbie Burns’ ‘Soldier’s Return’ was the cause. It was sung by recruiting sergeants in every corner of the Empire and many citizens yet living will remember hearing the old Peninsular war veteran telling of the magic effect of this song throughout the land.”General Sir Sam HughesThe Soldiers ReturnBy Robert BurnsWhen wild War’s deadly blast was blown, And gentle Peace returning.Wi’ mony a sweet babe fatherless, and mony a widow I left the lines and tented field, Where lang I7d been a lodger, My humble knapsack a my wealth,A poor and honest soldier.A leal light heart was in my breast,My hand unstained wi’ And for fair Scotia, hame again, I cheery on did wander,I thought upon the banks o’ Coil,I thought upon Nancy,I thought upon the witching smile,That caught my yeuthful fancy.At length I reached the honny glen Where early life I I passed the mill and trysting thorn,Where Nancy aft I courted;Wha spied I but my ain dear maik,Down by her mother’s dwelling;And turned me round to hede the flood That in my een was swelling. Wi’ altered voice, quoth I, “Sweet lass,Sweet as yon hawthorn’s blossom,Oh! happy, happy may he be,That’s dearest to thy bosom!My purse is light, I’ve far t gang.And fain would be thy lodger;I’ve served my king and counrty lang,Take pity on a sodger.”Sac wistfully she gazed on me,And lovelier was than ever;Quo’ she, “A sodger once I lo’d,Forget him shall I Our hamble cot, and hamely fare,Ye freely shall partake it;That gallant badge, the dear cockade,Ye’re welcome for the sake o’t.”She gazed she reddened like a rose,THen pale like only She sank within my arms, and cried,“Are thou my ain dear Willie?”“By Him who made you sun and skyBy whom true love’s regarded,I am the man; and thus may stillTrue lovers he rewarded.“The wars are o’er, and I’m come hame,And find three still ture-Though poor in gear, we’re rich in love,And mair we’ll ne’er be parted.”Quo’ she, “My grandsire left me gowd,A wee farm plenished fairly;And come, my faithful sodger lad,Thou’rt welcome to it dearly!”For gold the merchant ploughs the main,The farmer ploughs the manor;But glory is the sodger’s prize,The sodger’s wealth is honor.The brave poor sodger ne’er despise,Nor count him as a stranger;Remember he’s his country’s stay,In the day and hour of danger.By Courtesy of the Montreal Standard（義務の至る場所兵士の報酬）
