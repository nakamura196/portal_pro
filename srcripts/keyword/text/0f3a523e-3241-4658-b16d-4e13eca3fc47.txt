Borrow and buy.The time for argument has passed. The time for action has arrived.The present business of the United States is war. We are in it to the last dollar, to the last drop of blood, and we are prepared to fight it out on these lines. But whenever we can spend dollars instead of spending lives then we shall spend dollars - billions of  funi[ ? ]  the government [ ? ]  these dollars  - if not through voluntary subscription to bonds, then through higher taxes.If a man hesitates over an act which will save the life of your son you do not argue with him. It is not our heritage from the ages that we should argue and equivocate when human lives are hanging in the balance. When the choice is clear and sharp between lending money to Government and permitting one unnecessary life to be lost by our soldiers - when it is bonds or blood - when it is a simple financial arrangement at home or human agony on the fields of France - will any American hesitate?We must not talk in terms of investment when we should be talking in terms of human life. The only possible option left today is how ....The answer is clear. It is to borrow and buy. This is not finance. It is patriotism. Let us not mince words. Let us not temporize. Let us mobilize the magnificent machinery of the banks of America into the war-service of our Government in the most tremendous crisis in its history.Every an in the United States with a bank account must go to his bank, borrow all he can, and buy Government Bonds. Every bank must be ready and willing to lend.Delay costs blood - the blood of our sons.The undersigned banks pledge themselves to make loans on the 4% Government Bonds at the same rate of interest paid to you by the Government. Such loans will  not interfere with any borrower’s regular line of credit. We urge every bank in the United States to do likewise.American Exchange National BankAtlantic National Bank of the City of New YorkBank of AmericaBank of Cuba in New YorkBank of the Manhattan Co.Bank of the New York National Banking ASSN.Bank of United StatesBank of Washington HeightsBankers Trust Co.Battery Park National BankBroadway Central ParkBroadway Trust Co.Broadway National BankBryant Park BankCentral Trust Co. of New YorkChase National BankChatham &amp; Phenix National Bank of the City of New YorkChelsea Exchange BankChemical National BankCitizens National BankCoal &amp; Iron National BankColonial BankColumbia Trust Co.Commercial Trust Co.Corn Exchange BankCosmopolitan BankEmpire Trust Co.Equitable Trust Co.Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Co.Fidelity Trust Co.First National BankFulton Trust Co. of N.Y.Garfield National BankGerman American BankGerman Exchange BankGotham National BankGreenwich BankGuaranty Securities CorporationGuaranty Trust Co. of N.Y.Hanover National BankHudson Trust Co.Importers &amp; Traders National BankInternational BankInternational Banking CorporationIrving National BankLiberty National BankLincoln National BankLincoln Trust Co.Market &amp; Fulton National BankMechanics &amp; Metals National BankMerchants’ National BankMetropolitan BankMetropolitan BankMetropolitan Trust Co.Mutual BankNational Bank of Commerce in N.Y.National Buchers &amp; Drovers BankNational City BankNational Park BankNemeth, JohnNew York Produce Exchange BankNew York Trust Co.Pacific BankPeoples BankPublic National Bank of New YorkScandinavian Trust Co.Seaboard National BankSecond National BankSherman National BankTitle Guarantee &amp; Trust Co.Transatlantic Trust Co.Twenty-third Ward BankUnion Exchange National BankUnion Trust Company of New YorkU.S. Mortgage &amp; Trust Co.United States Trust Company of New York（借りて購入せよ議論の時は過ぎ去ったそして今、行動の時が訪れたのだ）
