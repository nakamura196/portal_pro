The Danger of OptimismMake no mistake, the war is not yet won. It won’t be won when we have pushed the Hun out of France; nor when we have cleared him out of Belgium; not even when we have crossed the Rhine. Look at the map! The battlefront is still nearly five hundred miles from Berlin.Nor must we think we have won when the Potsdam gang cries “Kamerad.”Optimistic war news is fine - but not final! To keep it coming, we must keep the boys going! The harder they fight now and the fuller the measure of your support, the sooner we and our Allies will dictate peace in the only place it can be dictated Berlin!Make the Liberty Bonds you buy show the full measure of your devotion to our Boys. Buy Liberty Bonds with every dollar you have saved　and then buy on installments with every dollar you can save in the months to come.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.Liberty Loan Committee, Third Federal Reserve District, Lincoln Building, Philadelphia（楽観主義の危険）
