A “Service Star” in Your Pocket BookOn September 28th the United States Government will give you your fourth opportunity to put a “service star” in your pocketbook. Either your pocketbook will proudly wear that star, because you lend your money to your Government, or you have a slacker purse.The slacker purse will buy neither peace nor pleasure.The slacker purse is an ally of the Hun.The slacker purse is a traitor.Make your plans now to put a service star in your pocketbook so that you can look at every service flag and know that you have done your duty.And make sure that in the Fourth Liberty Loan every pocketbook you know has its service star. See to it that among all your friends and acquaintances there shall be no slacker purses. Plan to buy bonds with every cent you have and then to buy more on installments with all you can possibly save in months to come.And Do It Bright and Early In The Morning of The Very First Day of The Campaign.（文庫本のなかの「将星」）
