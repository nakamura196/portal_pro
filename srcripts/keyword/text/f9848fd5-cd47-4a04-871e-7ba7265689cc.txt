Our brave sons are facing the fire of battle in defence of the honor and rights of America and the liberty of nations. To sustatin them and to assist our gallant associates in the war, a generous and patriotic people have been called upon to subscribe to the Third Liberty Loan.Now Therefore, I , Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America, do appointFriday, the 26th Day of April 1918 Liberty Day.On the afternoon of that day I request the people of the United States to assemble in their respective communities and liberally pledge anew their financial support to sustain the nation`s cause.Patriotic demonstrations should be held in every city, town and hamlet throughout the land, under the general direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and the immediate direction of the Liberty Loan Committees organized by the Federal Reserve Banks. Let the nation’s response to the Third Liberty Loan express in unmistakable terms the determination of America to fight for peace, the permanent peace of justice.For the purpose of participating in Liberty Day celebrations, all employes of the Federal Government throughout the country, whose services can be spared, may be excused at 12 o’clock noon, Friday, the 26th of April.In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Done in the District of Columbia, this 18th day of April, in the year of our Lord 1918, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-second.Woodrow WilsonBy the President Signed Robert LansingSecretary of StateLend him a hand.Buy Liberty Bonds.（アメリカ大統領からの自由の日宣言リバティ・デー　　1918年4月26日金曜日）
