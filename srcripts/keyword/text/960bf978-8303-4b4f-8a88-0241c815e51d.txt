Help feed yourself.Make back yards and vacant lots productive.Work a garden - raise chickens.Grow vegetables and fruits.If your soil is fertile and sunnyDon’t let your land loaf. Keep it working all season. Don’t assume that the season is too far advanced to begin garden operations. Some vegetables may be planted at practically any time until past the middle of summer. Start new crops between the rows of others that are soon to be removed.Begin over again in late summer and plant vegetables that mature best in cool weather, such as radishes, lettuce, spinach, kale.See that your garden toward fall is full of potatoes, beets, turnips, cabbage, and other staple foods that can be stored for the winter.Grow lima and navy beans for harvest when ripe.Can or preserve surplus perishables.Dry fruits and sweet corn and such other vegetables as may be preserved in this way. Can only the products that can not be kept otherwise.Concentrate products so that each jar or can will hold as much food and as little water as possible. There is a shortage of containers. Don’t let one be wasted in your home. Empty spices and similar materials from jars and fill them with food.Reserve regular tight-sealing containers for perishable vegetables, meat, and fish.Use wide-necked bottles with paraffin seals for putting up fruit and preserves
