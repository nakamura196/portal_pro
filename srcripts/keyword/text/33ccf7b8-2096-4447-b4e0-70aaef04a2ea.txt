By the president of the United States of AmericaA proclamationThe second Liberty Loan gives the people of the United States an opportunity to lend their funds to their government to sustain their country at war. The might of the United States is being mobilized and organized to strike a mortal blow at autocracy in defense of outraged American rights and of the cause of liberty. Billions of dollars are required to arm, feed, and clothe the brave men who are going forth to fight our country’s battles and to assist the nations with whom we are making common cause against a common foe. To subscribe to the Liberty Loan is to perform a service of patriotism.Now, therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson, President of the United States of America, do appoint Wednesday, the 24th of October, as Liberty Day and urge and advise the people to assemble in their respective communities and Pledge to one another and to the Government that represents them the fullest measure of financial support. On the afternoon of that day I request that patriotic meetings be held in every city, town, and hamlet throughout the land, under the general direction of the Secretary of the Treasury and the immediate direction of the Liberty Loan Committees which have been organized by the Federal Reserve Banks. The people responded nobly to the call of the first Liberty Loan with an oversubscription of more that 50 per cent. Let the response to the second loan be even greater, and let the amount be so impressive and emphatic that it will echo throughout the empire of our enemy as an index of what America intends to do to bring this war to a victorious conclusion.For the purpose of participating in Liberty Day celebrations all employes of the Federal Government throughout the country whose services can be spared may be excused at 12 o’clock Wednesday, the 24th of October.In witness whereof , I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.Done in the District of Columbia, this 12th day of October, in the year of our Lord, one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-second.By the President.Woodrow Wilson(Signed) Robert Lansing, Secretary of State（アメリカ合衆国大統領の宣言10月24日水曜日　自由の日大統領　ウッドロー・ウィルソン　　署名ロバート・ランシング国務長官）
