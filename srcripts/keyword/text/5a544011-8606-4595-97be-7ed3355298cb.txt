“America shall pay for this!”This man has thrown down the gauntlet to mankind. He has assumed to appropriate God to serve his own purposes as a tribal, Teutonic deity. He has set his Prussian “Kulfur” against the humanity of the world. He has defied international law, honor and justice. He has brutalized his own people, and sent them forth to ride rough-shod over the decent people of the earth. And when our manhood answered the challenge, he shouted, “America shall pay for this.”Away with him! The world cannot tolerate this blasphemer, despot, self-styled superman. Your Liberty Bonds are pledged to a holy cause in purging the earth of this unspeakable Hun! When September 28th comes, buy all you have the cash to pay for and pledge to buy all you can possibly awing on installments. And don’t delay!There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return your money with interest at 4 &lt;?&gt;The time to act is now! Liberty Loan Committee, Third Federal Resident District, Lincoln Building, Philadelphia（「アメリカはこの対価を支払うだろう！」）
