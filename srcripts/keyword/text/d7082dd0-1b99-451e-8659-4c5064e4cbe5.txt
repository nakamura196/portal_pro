Keep Up The SuppliesOver there in France are mammoth depots stored to the roof with war materials to keep the battle line supplied. Over here at a thousand wharves great ships are being laden to keep those depots filled.Think of the billions of dollars needed to supply them all! Think of the boys who are endangered, unless the supplies arrive on time! Then think of what YOU must do to keep the supplies going over.This Fourth Liberty Loan is your answer! Our boys do not say after a fight or two, “I have done enough.” Then, surely, neither will YOU! Buy every bond you have the cash to pay for, then pledge yourself to buy every one you can pay for in future installments.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!This space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（供給を維持しよう）
