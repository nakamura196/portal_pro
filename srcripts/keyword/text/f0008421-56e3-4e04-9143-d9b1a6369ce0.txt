On Our Own Shores!On June 3, 1918, the passenger steamship Carolina, 5000 tons, was sunk by a German submarine, 125 miles off Sandy Hook. The Germans signaled, “Don’t wireless ・we won’t shoot,” then torpedoed the ship and shelled the life - boats, with a loss of twenty lives. Within the next few days the U-boats added a score of other American vessels to their long list of crimes against humanity and humanity’s laws.Fire your own depth - bomb against the craft which prey upon women and little children ・the scorpions of the sea that sting and hide.Do your whole duty in buying bonds with every cent you can raise, and on installments with all you can save in the weeks ahead. There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%The time to act is now.（我々の海岸で！）
