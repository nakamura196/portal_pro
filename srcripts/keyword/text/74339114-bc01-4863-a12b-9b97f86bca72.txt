President Wilson says to you.“The reply of the German government to my note of inquiry dated Oct. 8 gives occasion for me to say to my fellow countrymen that neither that reply nor any other recent events have in any way diminished the vital importance of the Liberty Loan. Relaxation now, hesitation now, would mean defeat when victory seems to be in sight; would mean years of war instead of peace upon our own terms.“I earnestly request every patriotic American to leave to the governments of the United States and of the allies the momentous discussions initiated by Germany and to remember that for each man his duty is to strengthen the hands of these governments and to do it in the most important way now immediately presented- by subscribing to the utmost of his ability for bonds of the Fourth Liberty Loan. That loan must be successful. I am sure that the American People will not fail to see their duty and make it successful.”Double the Third!（ウィルソン大統領は皆さんに伝えます）
