The gray-green color, which is of vegetable origin and derived from their food, forms a deep fringe within the open edge of the oyster. Such oysters are often best and in France are prized above all others.Therefor eat oysters.It is a duty to utilize this vast food resource as far as possible and save other foods of which there is a dearth.It is also a pleasure to use the oyster which in other countries than our s is luxury rather than a common food.It is not one of the cheap foods when measured by the cost of its useful constituents, but it is valuable as an appetizing variant of the diet.
