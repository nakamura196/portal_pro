The White HouseWashingtonAgain the Government comes to the people of the country with the request that they lend their money, and lend it upon a mere liberal scale than ever before, in order that the great war for the rights of America and the liberation of the world may be prosecuted with ever increasing vigor to a victorious conclusion. And it makes the appeal with the greatest confidence because it knows that every day it is becoming clearer and clearer to thanking men throughout the nation that the winning of the war is an essential investment. The money that is held back now will be of little use or value if the war is not won and the selfish masters of Germany are permitted to dictate what America may and may not do. Men in America, besides, have from the first wake now dedicated both their lives and their fortunes to the vindication and maintenance of the great principles and objects for which our Government was set up. They will not fail now to show the world for what their wealth was intended.Woodrow Wilson（ホワイトハウスワシントン）
