Why is it necessary to eat less Meat and less Wheat Bread?The United States Food Administration asks you to get behind our soldiers, sailors and Allies by sending them now the most food possible in the least shipping space. Every man, woman and child in America can help by eating less wheat, beef, pork, fats and sugar, more of other plentiful foods which can not be shipped, and by avoiding waste.What the food situation isThe men of England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Italy and Belgium are fighting; they are not on the farms. The food production of these countries, our Allies, has therefore been greatly reduced. Even before the war it was much less than the amount consumed. The difference was supplied by the United States, Canada and other countries, including Russia, Roumania, South America, India, and Australia.This difference is now greater than ever, and at the same time, food can no longer be obtained from most of the outside countries.Therefore our Allies depend on North America for food as they have never depended before, and they ask us for it with a right which they have never had before. For today they are our companions in a great war against a common enemy. For the present it is they who are doing the fighting, the suffering, the dying－in our war.One million of the finest young men in the United States will soon be fighting side by side with the millions of brave soldier of France, Great Britain, Belgian, Italy and Russia.Millions of the men, women, and children of the United States can not go abroad and fight the enemy face to face. But they can not fight by helping the fighters fight.Why it is necessary to eat less wheat breadFrance, Great Britain, Italy and Belgian must now import sixty per cent of their breadstuffs instead of the forty per cent they imported before the war.America must supply the greater part of this need. To send them the least that they can live on we must increase our export of wheat from 88,000,000 bushels to 220,000,000 bushels.We can not send them corn because they have not enough mills to grind it. We can not send them corn meal because it spoils in shipping. The oats, rye, barley, etc. that we send will not support them unless mixed with wheat. We must send them more wheat, and to do this we must eat less wheat bread.Why it is necessary to eat less mealBecause oh the lack of fodder and the increased need of meat to feed the soldiers and war workers, France, Britain, Italy and Belgian have on hand today 33,000,000 less head of stock than they had before the war. Their herds are still decreasing in spite of the fact that we are now sending them three times as meat this year than ever before.Why it is necessary to eat less fatsThe chief source of fats for eating is in daily products. We are able to produce no more of these now than before the war. Yet last year we send our Allies three times as much butter and the times as much condensed milk as we used to send them. Because their milk cows are still decreasing we must send even more butter and condensed milk this year. Because their Hogs are decreasing we must send them more lard.Why it is necessary to eat less sugarBefore the war France, Italy and Belgian raised all their own sugar. Great Britain bought sugar from Germany.Now France, Italy and Belgian can not raise much sugar because their men are fighting and Great Britain can not buy sugar where she used to buy it.All must now get sugar where we get it, and there is not enough to go around useless we save.How you can helpEat less wheat breadHave at least one meal a day without wheat bread. Use instead corn, oat, rye, barley, or mixed cereal breads.Eat less cake and pastry.Order wheat bread from your baker at least 24 hours in advance so that he will not bake too much. Cut the loaf of wheat bread on the table. Use all stale wheat bread for toast or cooking.If every person in America consumes four pounds of wheat flour a week instead of five, we can ship the 220,000,000 bushels which our soldiers and our Allies must have.Eat less meatEat fish and other sea food, poultry and rabbits, instead of beef, mutton and pork. Fish, chicken, etc. can not be shipped in compact form like meat, and are more perishable.Do not use either beef, mutton, or pork more than once a day, and then serve smaller portions. Use all left-over meat cold or in made dishes. Use more soups. Use beans; they have nearly in same food value as meat.Remember that no grain or other human food was used to feed the fish that gives you nourishment. Save the products of the land.Eat less fatsUse no butter in cooking except left-over that would otherwise go to waste. Cook with olive or cottonseed oil instead. Save lard by eating less fried food.Try to use up all left-over fats in cooking, but if there is some you can not use save it carefully, make scrubbing soap out of it, or sell it to the soap maker.If every person in America saves one-third of an ounce of animal fat a day we can ship enough for our soldiers, sailors and Allies.Eat less sugarCut down on candy and sweet drinks. Eat half as much sweets as before and you are still eating more than Englishman or Frenchman gets.Use honey, maple sirup and corn sirup on the breakfast table instead of sugar.Serve cake without frosting or icing. Eat plenty of fruit.If every person in America saves an ounce of sugar a day our soldier, sailors and Allies will be provided forBurn less coalThe rail can not carry coal to you and also handle military supplies in the quickest way. Help by burning less coal.Coal supplies power for electric light and steam heat. Turn off both when you don’t need them.If you can get wood, use it instead of coal.Eat plenty, wisely, without waste, and help win the war.United States Food Administration（なぜ肉と小麦パンを食べ控える必要があるのか？たっぷり、賢く、無駄なく食べよう、そして戦争勝利を助けよう合衆国食糧管理局）
