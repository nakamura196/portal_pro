“Leave no tree in France standing!”(German Official Edict)Wherever the Hun has gone, there he has left wanton, needless, desolation. Towns and villages have been sacked and burned, cathedrals destroyed, even the unoffending trees felled to earth in his diabolic purpose to create a desert where the labor of centuries had made the land to smile. This is not war, but　the hellish instinct of barbaric vandalism!We have pledged our men, our money resources to overwhelm this ruthless force that hates all progress other than its own. Come forward, America, with your support! Enlist every dollar you can save and spare to this supremely necessary end! No man has done his duty until he has bought all the Liberty Bonds he has the cash to pay for and all he can pay for in installments in the months to come.The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!（「フランスに立木を残すな！」）
