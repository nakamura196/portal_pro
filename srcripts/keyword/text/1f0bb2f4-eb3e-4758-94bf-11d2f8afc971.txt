They call this warfare!Deliberate attacks on hospitals and U-boat destruction of hospital ships at sea such are samples of Hun warfare. They know no code of honor, no principle of humanity, no respect for condition of life. Their plan and purpose are destruction and the creation of terror in the breasts of those who resist.This spirit must be crushed out forever.Pile up the money, mass the men, multiply the guns, the munitions, the American bayonets that shall teach these beasts the virtue of right and might combined!Make the magnitude of your subscriptions to this Fourth Liberty Loan overwhelm them, strike the sneer form from their lips, and terror to their savage breasts. Your share is all the bonds you can pay cash for, and all you can buy on installments.Liberty Loan CommitteeThird Federal Reserve DistrictLincoln Building PhiladelphiaThere is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4 %.The time to act is now!（やつらはこれを戦争とよんでいる！）
