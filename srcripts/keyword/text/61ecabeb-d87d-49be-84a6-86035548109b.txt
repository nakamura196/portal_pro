Shoulder to ShoulderNow, then, all together! This war is the concern of all of us! We’re brothers in arms! The man at home who can’t fight can help! The boys at the front, on the decks of destroyers and cruisers - how proud we are of them! They are doing their part - we must do ours! While they fight, we must save and buy Liberty Bonds to back up their splendid courage.Have you bought Bonds until it hurts? Have you subscribed for a hundred or a thousand, when to be worthy of them you should buy what you know to be your limit?This is a matter for every American’s conscience.Do your full duty, if you want to stand shoulder to shoulder with our boys!Buy Liberty Bonds with all the cash you have and then buy more on installments for all you can save in the months ahead.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest at 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.（互いに協力して）
