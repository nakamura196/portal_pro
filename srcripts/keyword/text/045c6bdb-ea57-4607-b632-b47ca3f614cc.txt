Blind The Huns!Aeroplanes are the eyes of the Army. Overwhelming thousands of these air fighters will place in the hands of Marshal Foch the exact location of enemy forces in every sector of the front and prevent the enemy from learning the disposal of our boys. This alone may save the life of your own son or brother or husband, and the tens of thousands of others.Measure your safety against the risk of every noble aviator fighting for you - he goes up today and returns; he may do the same thing tomorrow and the next day, but he never knows if he will come down alive or dead. Yet he does it day after day and feels his job is never done. Neither is yours, not even if you bought a Liberty Bond every day.Americans, fight with your dollars, stand staunch behind the brave boys. Buy with your cash and buy on installments. And do it now!The space contributed by patriotic business firms of Philadelphia.There is immediate and urgent need for every dollar you can spare. You are only lending, not giving your money. Your Government guarantees the return of your money with interest 4 1/4%.The time to act is now!（フン族［ドイツ兵］の視界を奪え！）
